How to Make Learning as Addictive as Social Media | Duolingo's Luis Von Ahn | TED,"When technologist Luis von Ahn was building the popular language-learning platform Duolingo, he faced a big problem: Could an app designed to teach you something ever compete with addictive platforms like Instagram and TikTok? He explains how Duolingo harnesses the psychological techniques of social media and mobile games to get you excited to learn ‚Äî all while spreading access to education across the world.

But what is a neural network? | Deep learning chapter 1,"What are the neurons, why are there layers, and what is the math underlying it?
Help fund future projects: https://www.patreon.com/3blue1brown
Written/interactive form of this series: https://www.3blue1brown.com/topics/neural-networks

Additional funding for this project was provided by Amplify Partners

Typo correction: At 14 minutes 45 seconds, the last index on the bias vector is n, when it's supposed to in fact be a k.  Thanks for the sharp eyes that caught that!

For those who want to learn more, I highly recommend the book by Michael Nielsen introducing neural networks and deep learning: https://goo.gl/Zmczdy

There are two neat things about this book.  First, it's available for free, so consider joining me in making a donation to Nielsen if you get something out of it.  And second, it's centered around walking through some code and data which you can download yourself, and which covers the same example that I introduce in this video.  Yay for active learning!
https://github.com/mnielsen/neural-networks-and-deep-learning

I also highly recommend Chris Olah's blog: http://colah.github.io/

For more videos, Welch Labs also has some great series on machine learning:

Animations largely made using manim, a scrappy open source python library.  https://github.com/3b1b/manim

If you want to check it out, I feel compelled to warn you that it's not the most well-documented tool, and has many other quirks you might expect in a library someone wrote with only their own use in mind.

For any early-stage ML startup founders, Amplify Partners would love to hear from you via 3blue1brown@amplifypartners.com

To learn more, I highly recommend the book by Michael Nielsen
http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/
The book walks through the code behind the example in these videos, which you can find here:

Also check out Chris Olah's blog: 
http://colah.github.io/
His post on Neural networks and topology is particular beautiful, but honestly all of the stuff there is great.

And if you like that, you'll *love* the publications at distill:
https://distill.pub/

For more videos, Welch Labs also has some great series on machine learning:

""But I've already voraciously consumed Nielsen's, Olah's and Welch's works"", I hear you say.  Well well, look at you then.  That being the case, I might recommend that you continue on with the book ""Deep Learning"" by Goodfellow, Bengio, and Courville.

Why Should We Hire You? | Best Answer for Freshers & Experienced People | ChetChat Interview Tips,"Watch the best answers to the interview question why should we hire you, some sample answers for freshers and best answer for experienced including job interview tips with sample answers on why should we hire you with the best answer in the simplest format. 

I remember, back when I was doing my MBA at XLRI, Jamshedpur the placement season was the most dreaded time. And the one question I was most scared of was 'Why should I hire you'. I used to think - what am I supposed to say? How can I sit there and just praise myself, like I am so great , it is so weird.
This is a very difficult question because -
 
1. It usually comes right at the end, when you have finished the technical parts of the interview and you think, ah! thank god it's over and boom - why should we hire you
2. It also sometimes may mean that they have not been able to make up their minds about you. They may be confused and so they are giving you one last chance to sell yourself.
So in this video we will cover -
1. Structure of the answer 
2. Lots of sample answers and ideas for many different types of jobs like sales jobs, 3D animators, technical writers, BPO jobs, accountants and more .
3. Some Rules and common mistakes.

****************************************************************

Let‚Äôs accept it. Giving interviews sucks. Wearing crisp clothes and telling the interviewer sitting infront of you, how you are a perfect fit for the company confidently, while you are shaking inside is not an easy job.
But don‚Äôt worry, because the interviewer was once an interviewee. So even they want you to do well because at the end of the day, they want to hire you. All they are asking, is for you to be prepared. And today, by the end of this video, I am going to get you prepared.
Before we begin, let‚Äôs understand this. There are 3 different types of interview questions. 
1) Technical 2) Analytical and 3) Behavioural.
If you are applying for I.T. then technical will be about coding, programming etc. 
Analytical questions will be like‚Ä¶how many ping-ping bolls can you fit in a Boeing; after you cut a slice from a cake, how will you divide it into equal parts so on and so forth. Through analytical questions they want to know how are your problem solving skills. 
And finally, there are behavioural questions. Through these questions the interviewer wants to know ‚Ä¶tumne life me kiya kya hai i.e how you‚Äôve handled work situations in the past or about your education.
In my experience around 65-70% of the questions will be behavioural because using them, the interviewer will decide whether you are a good fit for the job or not ‚Ä¶and that‚Äôs what we are going to nail in this video. So today, we are going to discuss‚Ä¶

Today‚Äôs Agenda:

1)¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†The 8 most commonly asked interview questions:

a) Tell me about yourself
b)¬†Why do you want this job?¬†
c)¬†What are your strengths and weaknesses?
d)¬†Tell me about a challenge or conflict you have faced at work and how you‚Äôve dealt with it?
e) Where do you see yourself in 5 years? (What are your short-term/long term goals?)
f)¬†Are you planning to have children?
g)¬†Do you have any questions for us?
h)¬†Why should we hire you?

2)¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†We are going to analyse these questions based on a) What the interviewer wants to know b) Common Mistakes we make while answering and c) How to answer this question.

3)¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†But most importantly, towards the end I‚Äôll give you a Bonus Tip for cracking even the toughest of interviews.

I hope you find the video useful. :)

Ugly History: The Armenian Genocide - √úmit Kurt,"Dig into the history of the Armenian Genocide, during which the Ottoman Empire killed over 1 million Armenians during WWI.

--

When an Armenian resistance movement began to form in the 19th century, Sultan Abdul Hamid II took decisive action. He led the Hamidian Massacres‚Äî a relentless campaign of violence that killed over 150,000 Armenians. These massacres were the culmination of centuries of oppression, yet they were only the beginning of an even greater tragedy. √úmit Kurt uncovers the history of the Armenian Genocide.

Lesson by √úmit Kurt, directed by H√©lo√Øse Dorsan-Rachet.

How do kidney transplants work? - Alexander H. Toledo,"Dig into the science of how kidney transplants work, how donors are matched and find out how this surgery saves lives.

--

In 1954, Joseph Murray attempted a type of kidney swap that no doctor had tried before. The surgery was a success, and the patient would go on to live with the transplanted organ thanks to one key factor: it came from his identical twin. 70 years later, nearly 100,000 kidneys are transplanted annually in the US alone. So how does this surgery work today? Alexander H. Toledo explains the procedure.

Why is Alzheimer‚Äôs disease so difficult to treat? - Krishna Sudhir,"Dig into how Alzheimer‚Äôs disease affects your brain and cognitive abilities, and what makes the disorder so hard to treat.

--

Around the world, millions of people have Alzheimer‚Äôs disease, a debilitating brain disorder that gradually destroys a person‚Äôs memory and other cognitive abilities. While doctors have studied Alzheimer‚Äôs for decades, conducting hundreds of clinical trials, there is still no effective preventive treatment or cure. So, why is Alzheimer‚Äôs disease so difficult to treat? Krishna Sudhir investigates.

How close are we to powering the world with nuclear fusion? - George Zaidan,"Explore the possibility of nuclear fusion technology to create limitless, on-demand energy with almost no emissions. 

--

Stars have cores hot and dense enough to force atomic nuclei together, forming larger, heavier nuclei in a process known as fusion. In this process, the mass of the end products is slightly less than the mass of the initial atoms. But that ‚Äúlost‚Äù mass doesn‚Äôt disappear ‚Äî it‚Äôs converted to energy ... a lot of energy. So, can we harness this energy to power the world? George Zaidan investigates.

How does an air conditioner actually work? - Anna Rothschild,"Dig into the science of how heat pumps both heat and cool a home, and find out the benefits and drawbacks of this technology.

--

Typically, with any piece of technology, you pump one unit of energy in and you get about one out. That‚Äôs just the first law of thermodynamics: energy has to be conserved. But there‚Äôs a piece of technology called a heat pump, where for every bit of energy you put in, you get three to five times as much heat out. What wizardry is this? Anna Rothschild investigates the science of heat pumps.

Europa Clipper: NASA‚Äôs Mission to Jupiter's Ocean Moon (Mission Trailer),"Our solar system has a number of worlds with water, but is Earth the only one with the right environment to support life? That‚Äôs the question NASA‚Äôs Europa Clipper aims to answer. 

Europa Clipper is the first mission dedicated to studying Jupiter‚Äôs moon Europa, which scientists believe has a salty ocean under its icy shell. While not designed to detect life, the spacecraft is equipped with nine science instruments and a gravity experiment, which will all help determine whether this moon could be habitable. Europa Clipper will orbit Jupiter and make 49 flybys of Europa, taking detailed measurements and high-resolution pictures. 

Europa Clipper is set to launch in October 2024 from NASA‚Äôs Kennedy Space Center in Florida, arriving at Jupiter in 2030. Watch it lift off live: https://plus.nasa.gov

"But why would light ""slow down""? | Optics puzzles 3","How the index of refraction arises, and why it depends on color.
Quotebook Notebooks: https://3b1b.co/store
These lessons are primarily funded directly by viewers: https://3b1b.co/support
An equally valuable form of support is to simply share the videos.

Looking Glass Universe videos on the index of refraction:
https://youtu.be/uo3ds0FVpXs

Much of this video is based on the following Feynmann lecture
https://www.feynmanlectures.caltech.edu/I_31.html

The explanation for why the phase of a wave produced by a plane of oscillating charges is a quarter phase behind the wave of a charge in the center of that plane, and hence a quarter phase behind that of a light wave inducing the oscillations, is given in the previous chapter:
https://www.feynmanlectures.caltech.edu/I_30.html

0:00 - The standard explanation
3:14 - The plan
5:09 - Phase kicks
8:25 - What causes light?
13:20 - Adding waves

In this video, I address the age old question: Is it the volts or amps that kill?

I originally covered this topic in a short video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Wx6-ysokJU

However, my explanation there seemed to generate a lot of controversy among ""professionals"" that work with electricity. I decided to make a more thorough explanation with this video. However, my stance on the matter is unchanged!

How Does the Internet Work? - Glad You Asked S1,"For most of us, the internet is virtual, made of Instagram posts, emails and YouTube videos. And, access to the vital utility isn‚Äôt guaranteed across the world. Glad You Asked host Cleo Abram wants to know: What is the internet actually made of? And, how does it work? Answering that question involves discovering how internet cables are laid in the sea, if 5G is really the future, and how balloons in the stratosphere are helping people connect.

How do Graphics Cards Work?  Exploring GPU Architecture,"Interested in working with Micron to make cutting-edge memory chips?  Work at Micron:  https://bit.ly/micron-careers 
Learn more about Micron's Graphic Memory!  Explore Here: https://bit.ly/micron-graphic-memory
Curious about AI memory and HBM3E?  Take a look:  https://bit.ly/micron-hbm3e

Graphics Cards can run some of the most incredible video games, but how many calculations do they perform every single second?  Well, some of the most advanced graphics perform 36 Trillion calculations or more every single second.  But how can a single device manage these tens of trillions of calculations?  In this video, we explore the architecture inside the 3090 graphics card and the GA102 GPU chip architecture.  

Note: We chose to feature the 30 series of GPUs because, to create accurate 3D models, we had to tear down a 3090 GPU rather destructively. We typically select a slightly older model because we're able to find broken components on eBay. If you're wondering, the 4090 can perform 82.58 trillion calculations a second, and then we're sure the 5090 will be even more.

Prof. Tony Lynch - The Importance of Listening to International Students,"Professor Tony Lynch, Personal Chair of Student Learning (English for Academic Purposes), presented his inaugural lecture entitled ""The Importance of Listening to International Students"".

The title is intentionally ambiguous. It refers firstly to the importance for international students of having adequate comprehension of spoken English; and it also alludes to the importance for the University of taking account of international students' perceptions of studying at Edinburgh.

In the lecture, Prof Lynch addresses both these issues. In the first part he draws on his research into the experience of second language listeners, in order to outline the processes underlying comprehension, the problems likely to arise, and possible solutions to those difficulties.

In the second part he discuss postgraduates' responses to an ELTC (English Language Teaching Centre) survey on linguistic and cultural aspects of studying at Edinburgh. He argues that relatively minor adjustments by and for international students would help smooth their path to academic success.

How To Train Your Dragon | Official Teaser Trailer,"How To Train Your Dragon - In Theaters June 13

From three-time Oscar¬Æ nominee and Golden Globe winner Dean DeBlois, the creative visionary behind DreamWorks Animation‚Äôs acclaimed How to Train Your Dragon trilogy, comes a stunning live-action reimagining of the film that launched the beloved franchise. 
On the rugged isle of Berk, where Vikings and dragons have been bitter enemies for generations, Hiccup (Mason Thames; The Black Phone, For All Mankind) stands apart. The inventive yet overlooked son of Chief Stoick the Vast (Gerard Butler, reprising his voice role from the animated franchise), Hiccup defies centuries of tradition when he befriends Toothless, a feared Night Fury dragon. Their unlikely bond reveals the true nature of dragons, challenging the very foundations of Viking society. 

With the fierce and ambitious Astrid (BAFTA nominee Nico Parker; Dumbo, The Last of Us) and the village‚Äôs quirky blacksmith Gobber (Nick Frost; Snow White and the Huntsman, Shaun of the Dead) by his side, Hiccup confronts a world torn by fear and misunderstanding. 
As an ancient threat emerges, endangering both Vikings and dragons, Hiccup‚Äôs friendship with Toothless becomes the key to forging a new future. Together, they must navigate the delicate path toward peace, soaring beyond the boundaries of their worlds and redefining what it means to be a hero and a leader. 

The film also stars Julian Dennison (Deadpool 2), Gabriel Howell (Bodies), Bronwyn James (Wicked), Harry Trevaldwyn (Smothered), Ruth Codd (The Midnight Club), BAFTA nominee Peter Serafinowicz (Guardians of the Galaxy) and Murray McArthur (Game of Thrones).
How to Train Your Dragon is written, produced and directed by DeBlois. It is also produced by three-time Oscar¬Æ nominee Marc Platt (Wicked, La La Land) and Emmy winner Adam Siegel (Drive, 2 Guns). How To Train Your Dragon is part of the Filmed For IMAX¬Æ Program, which offers filmmakers IMAX¬Æ technology to help them deliver the most immersive movie experience to audiences around the world. 

Inspired by Cressida Cowell‚Äôs New York Times bestselling book series, DreamWorks Animation‚Äôs How to Train Your Dragon franchise has captivated global audiences, earning four Academy Award¬Æ nominations and grossing more than $1.6 billion at the global box-office. Now, through cutting-edge visual effects, DeBlois transforms his beloved animated saga into a breathtaking live-action spectacle, bringing the epic adventures of Hiccup and Toothless to life with jaw-dropping realism as they discover the true meaning of friendship, courage and destiny.

Mild symptoms include pain and swelling at the sting site. Severe symptoms include muscle twitching, sweating and drooling. Most stings don't need treatment. Severe cases may need anti-venom.

Lyrics:

Husan tera tauba tauba x 4

Oh le liya kudi ne dil sadda
Hale thoda saaf jeha ni lagda irada
Guth Bali lambi ni rakhi muttiyar ne
Dekhta paranda naio dikhta prada
Figure te lagdi Latino 
ek vari dasdo eni kyu shakino 
kal hi tu Italy toh aai marjaniye 
te purse tu Paris toh magaya valintino 
Haan tenu kyu na dikha  tere toh ki sikha tere te ki likha

Husan tera tauba tauba x  4 

Sohniye ne akh teri thief ah aa 
era Gera dekhti ni Edda ta sharif ya ethe kehendi too much Desi 
tahi chill kare London te party at Ibiza 
sade lei free  nei pora lagdi 
IG story toh ta Bora Bora lagdi 
awaaz Teri soniye surili noori vargi jaddo lakh Hilda odo ta nora lagdi
Haan milna dasde koi tha dasde meri Jaan dasde 

Husan tera tauba tauba  x 4

Hae mitran toh akhan Teri mange kangana 
hune  mei banada menu das da sahi Jaan mangla mei tereto Jaan varda appe niklugi tu hass ta sahi tere vich Nasha pehle todh da kude 
soniye sharab da ta naam lagda 
sade toh chadai Teri vadh ho gai ni nikale ta sadhka te jaam lagda

Haan gal Maan meri mehmaan meri tu hai Jaan meri 

Husan tera tauba tauba x 4

(Le ke aaya bhi main ghar se rajaayi ‡§®‡§á) √ó2

Nahin aayi aayi aayi
Tu toh aayi ‡§®‡§á

Nahin aayi aayi aayi
Tu toh aayi ‡§®‡§á

Kaati raat maine kheton mein
Tu aayi ‡§®‡§á

Nikal rahi thi main toh ‡§∏‡§ú ke
‡§∏‡§Å‡§µ‡§∞ ke
Toka meri amma ne
Aankhein badi kar ke

Boli mujhe kyon ri
Kahan chali ‡§ï‡§≤‡§Æ‡•Ç‡§à

Kheton mein ‡§ï‡•Å‡§Å‡§µ‡§æ‡§∞‡•Ä chhori jaati nahin yunhi

Aise ladke jo kheton mein bulaate hain

‡§π‡§æ‡§Å
Aise ladke jo kheton mein bulaate hain

Beti bante kabhi bhi vo jamai ‡§®‡§á

(Kaati raat maine kheton mein
Tu aayi ‡§®‡§á) √ó2

Jaane ye deevaana
Palkein bichhaana
Aata hai tujhe
Bas karna bahaana

Sunke duhaayi
Aayi re qayaamat
Phir bhi hua ‡§®
Kabhi tera aana

(‡§¢‡§≤‡•Ä jaaye re jawani intezaar mein) √ó2

Tere chakkar mein doosri pataayi ‡§®‡§á

CHORUS
(Kaati raat maine kheton mein
Tu aayi ‡§®‡§á) √ó2

Lyrics:

Talwaaron pe sar waar diye 
Angaaron me jism jalaya hai..
Tab jaa ke kahin humne sar pe
Ye Kesari rang sajaya hai..!!!

Ae meri zameen, afsos nahin, jo tere liye sau dard sahe..
Mahfooz rahe, teri aan sadaa, chahe jaan meri ye rahe na rahe..

Ae meri zameen, mahboob meri, meri nas-nas mein tera Ishq bahe
Pheeka na pade kabhi rang tera, jismon se nikal ke khoon kahe..

Teri mitti me mil jaawaan
Gul ban ke main khil jaawaan
Itni si, hai dil ki‚Ä¶ aarzu..

Teri nadiyon mein bah jaawaan..
Teri Kahiton me lahraawaan.. 
Itni si, hai dil ki‚Ä¶ aarzu‚Ä¶.!!!

Sarson se bhare, wo khet mere, jahan jhoom ke bhangdaa paa na saka..  
Aaabad rahe, wo gaanw mera, jahan laut ke wapas jaa na saka..

O watna ve, mere watna ve, tera mera pyaar niralaa thaa..
Qurbaan hua, teri asmat pe, main kitna naseebon wala thaa..

Teri mitti mein mil jaawaan
Gul ban ke main khil jaawaan
Itni si, hai dil ki‚Ä¶ aarzu..

Teri nadiyon mein bah jaawaan..
Teri Kahiton me lahraawaan.. 
Itni si, hai dil ki‚Ä¶ aarzu‚Ä¶.!!!

Verse 3

O heer meri, tu hasti rahe, teri aankh ghadi bhar nam na ho
Main marta tha, jis mukhde pe, kabhi uska ujala kam na ho..
O maayi meri, kya fikra tujhe, kyun aankh se dariya bahta hai.. 
Tu kahti thee, tera chaand hoon main, aur chaand humesha rahta hai..

Teri mitti me mil jaawaan
Gul ban ke main khil jaawaan
Itni si, hai dil ki‚Ä¶ aarzu..

Teri nadiyon me bah jaawaan..
Teri faslon me lahraawaan.. 
Itni si, hai dil ki‚Ä¶ aarzu‚Ä¶.!!!

Paon Ki Jutti - Jyoti Nooran | Isha Malviya | Shiv Panditt | Jaani | Arvvindr S Khaira | Bunny,"Desi Melodies is proud to present an evocative display of storytelling, Jyoti Nooran's powerful voice takes center stage in 'Paon Ki Jutti,' crafted by the poetic genius Jaani, with an enthralling composition by Bunny. The song features the acting talents of Shiv Panditt and Isha Malviya, under the directorial eye of Arvvindr S Khaira. Together, they vividly portray a woman's struggle in a toxic relationship. 

The chorus, ""Me teri paaon ki juti na ki jab mann kare pehen li utar di,"" acts as a haunting echo of subservience, where the protagonist likens herself to an object as dispensable and easily manipulated as footwear‚Äîworn and discarded at whim. Through his soul-stirring lyrics, Jaani conveys the bleakness of a young woman's life mired in desolation. She voices her turmoil and the oppressive weight of a toxic relationship that binds her, stripping away her freedom to live as she desires. The sequence of events artfully illustrates her struggle, her yearning for liberty, and the harsh reality of her entrapment. The climax unfolds with an unexpected resolution, avoiding clich√©s, and provides a conclusion that not only surprises but also lingers with the audience, prompting profound reflection on the boundaries of love and control.

Lyrics of Chikni Chameli - ‡§ö‡§ø‡§ï‡§®‡•Ä ‡§ö‡§Æ‡•á‡§≤‡•Ä
bicchu mere naina, badi zeherili ankkh maare
kamsin kamriya saali ik thumke se lakh maare
haye bicchu mere naina, badi zeherili ankkh maare
kamsin kamriya saali ik thumke se lakh maare
note hazaaro ke khulla chhutta karaane aayi
husn ki teeli se beedi chillam jalaane aayi
aayi chikni chameli chhupke akeli pavva chadhake aayi
aayi chikni chameli chhupke akeli pavva chadhake aayi
aayi chikni chameli chhupke akeli pavva chadhake aayi
aayi chikni chameli chhupke akeli pavva chadhake aayi

jungle me aaj mangal karungi bhukhe shero se khelugi main
makkhan jaisi hatheli pe jalte angaare le lungi main
haye gehre paani ki machhli hu raja
ghsat ghsat dariya me ghumi hu main
teri nazron ki lehero se haar ke aaj dubi hu mai
hoye jaanleva jalwa hai, dekhne me halwa hai
jaanleva jalwa hai, hai dekhne me halwa hai
pyaar se paros doongi toot le zara
ye to trailer hai, puri film dikhaane aayi
husn ki teeli se bidi chillam jalaane aayi
aayi chikni chameli chhup ke akeli pavva chadhake aayi
aayi chikni chameli chhup ke akeli pavva chadhake aayi
aayi chikni chameli chhup ke akeli pavva chadhake aayi
aayi chikni chameli chhup ke akeli pavva chadhake aayi

banjar basti me aayi hai masti aisa namkin chehra tera
meri niyat pe chad gaya chhute na hai rang gehra tera
joban ye mera khenchi hai raja saare pardo ko katungi main
shaame meri akeli hai aaja sang tere baatungi main
haye baato me ishaara hai, jisme khel saara hai
baato me ishara hai jisme khel saara hai
tod ke tijoriyo ko loot le zara
choom ke zakhmo pe thoda malham lagaane aayi
husn ki teeli se beedi chillam jalaane aayi
aayi chikni aayi, aayi chikni aayi
aayi chikni chameli chhup ke akeli pavva chadhake aayi
aayi chikni chameli chhup ke akeli pavva chadhake aayi

Deva Shree Ganesha (X18)

Jwaala Si Jalti Hai Aankhon Mein Jiske Bhi
Dil Mein Tera Naam Hai
Parwah Hi Kya Uska Aarambh Kaisa Hai
Aur Kaisa Parinam Hai
Dharti Ambar Sitaare
Uski Nazarein Utaarein
Dar Bhi Us Se Daraa Re
Jiski Rakhwaliyan Re Karta Saya Tera
Deva Shree Ganesha (X8)

Ho Teri Bhakti Ka Vardan Hai
Jo Kamaye Wo Dhanwan Hai
Bin Kinaare Ki Kashti Hai Woh
Deva Tujhse Jo Anjaan Hai
Yoon To Mooshak Sawari Teri
Sab Pe Hai Peharedaari Teri
Paap Ki Aandhiyan Laakh Hon
Kabhi Jyoti Na Haari Teri
Apni Takdeer Ka Woh Khud Sikandar Hua Re
Bhool Ke Yeh Jahan Re Jis Kisi Ne Yahan Re
Saath Paaya Tera Hey
Deva Shree Ganesha X (8)

Ho Teri Dhooli Ka Teeka Kiye
Deva Jo Bhakt Tera Jiye
Use Amrit Ka Hai Moh Kya
Hans Ke Vish Ka Woh Pyaala Piye
Teri Mahima Ke Chhaya Tale
Kaal Ke Rath Ka Pahiya Chale
Ek Chingari Pratishodh Se
Khadi Raavan Ki Lanka Jale
Shatruon Ki Kataarein Ik Akele Se Haarein
Kan Bhi Parbat Hua Re, Shlok Ban Ke Jahan Re
Naam Aaya Tera Hey
Deva Shree Ganesha X (8)

About Taarak Mehta Ka Ooltah Chashmah:
----------------------------------------------------------------------
The show is inspired by the famous humorous column 'Duniya Ne Undha Chasma' by the eminent Gujarati writer Mr Tarak Mehta. This story evolves around happenings in ""Gokuldham Co-operative Society"" and covers topical issues that are socially relevant. The show predominantly revolves around 'Jethalaal' (Dilip Joshi), an uneducated Gujarati businessman. Your 'Taarak Mehta' (Sailesh Lodha), is his neighbour. 'Jethalaal' finds a friend and philosopher in 'Taarak Mehta' and often goes to him for advice whenever he is in trouble. Jethalaal's family includes his simpleton wife 'Daya Ben' (Disha Wakani) and a mischievous son 'Tapu' (Raj Anankat). Tapu is a menace and a constant source of trouble to all the members of Gokuldham. They have often warned 'Jethalaal' to reform 'Tapu' or be prepared to leave the premises.

Lost hopes of being heard by his son push Jethalaal' to call his father 'Champaklal' (Amit Bhatt) from the village. This was his great idea of leashing some control over the mischievous Tapu. The opposite happens and the grandfather joins hands with the grandson to make life a roller coaster troublesome ride for Jethalal.
